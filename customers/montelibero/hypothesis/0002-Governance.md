### Hypothesis 0002: Governance

**Hypothesis:**  
Governance processes within Montelibero are currently inefficient and could significantly benefit from blockchain-based governance solutions, enhancing transparency and community participation.

**Objective:**  
Identify governance-related challenges and needs among Montelibero's residents to tailor our blockchain governance solutions effectively.

**Test Questions:**  
1. What are the current inefficiencies in Montelibero's governance processes?
2. Are residents interested in blockchain solutions for more transparent and participative governance?
3. What specific features of blockchain governance are most appealing to the community?

**Method:**  
Conduct interviews focusing on governance experiences within Montelibero and the potential interest in blockchain governance innovations.

**Success Metrics:**  
- At least 70% of participants indicate issues with current governance mechanisms and show interest in blockchain solutions.
- Identification of at least two governance challenges mentioned by more than 50% of respondents as critical for improvement with blockchain.

**If Hypothesis is Confirmed:**  
- Develop detailed proposals for blockchain governance solutions.
- Discuss these proposals with Montelibero's representatives for potential implementation.

**If Hypothesis is Refuted:**  
- Investigate further to understand the governance needs and preferences.
- Adjust project approaches based on insights and consider different ways to contribute to Montelibero's governance improvement.
