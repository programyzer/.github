### Hypothesis 0001: DeFi

**Hypothesis:**  
Montelibero's residents experience significant challenges with traditional financial services that can be alleviated through decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions built on blockchain technology.

**Objective:**  
To uncover and validate specific financial needs and obstacles faced by the community, directing our blockchain solutions to meet these requirements effectively.

**Test Questions:**  
1. What difficulties do residents encounter with current financial services?
2. Are there specific DeFi applications or features residents are keen to use?
3. How familiar are residents with DeFi and its potential benefits for their financial activities?

**Method:**  
Interview a broad segment of Montelibero's population, focusing on their financial service experiences and openness to DeFi solutions.

**Success Metrics:**  
- Over 70% of interviewees express dissatisfaction with traditional financial services and interest in DeFi alternatives.
- At least two financial challenges are identified by more than 50% of participants as crucial for improvement through DeFi.

**If Hypothesis is Confirmed:**  
- Formulate detailed DeFi project plans addressing these financial challenges.
- Propose these plans to Montelibero for collaboration opportunities.

**If Hypothesis is Refuted:**  
- Reevaluate the focus of financial solutions and explore further to identify unmet needs.
- Modify project proposals based on feedback and seek alternative engagement strategies with the community.
