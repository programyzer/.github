**Alternatives Considered: Cardano**

Cardano, a research-driven blockchain platform, offers advantages that initially aligned with the goals of our Web 2.5 project:

* **Emphasis on Security and Decentralization:** Cardano's methodical development process and focus on peer-reviewed research aim for long-term resilience and a high degree of decentralization. These values resonated with our principles.
* **Scalability Potential:** Cardano's development roadmap outlines solutions like Hydra, which could significantly improve scalability. This addresses a key requirement for our growing user base.
* **Smart Contract Capabilities:**  Cardano supports smart contracts, enabling the implementation of governance or marketplace elements within our platform.

**Why Cardano Wasn't the Primary Choice**

* **Smart Contract Ecosystem (at the time of evaluation):** While Cardano supports smart contracts, its ecosystem is less mature compared to competitors like Ethereum or Polygon. This could mean fewer readily available developer tools and resources. 
* **Slower Development Pace:** Cardano's emphasis on rigorous research and validation can lead to a slower rollout of upgrades and features compared to more agile blockchain projects.
* **Transaction Costs (relative to Stellar):** While Cardano's aim is to have reasonable fees, Stellar's dedicated focus on minimal transaction costs currently better aligns with our prioritization of accessibility for libertarian communities.

**Potential for Cardano in Our Project**

Despite not being the primary choice, Cardano remains promising for potential future integration:

* **Long-Term Potential:** If Cardano successfully executes on its scalability and smart contracts roadmap, it could become a strong candidate for core parts of our infrastructure.
* **Specific Use Cases:** Cardano might be ideal for use cases where its focus on security and decentralization becomes paramount.

**We will continue to track Cardano's development closely. Advancements in its scalability and smart contracts ecosystem could lead to its integration within specific aspects of our Web 2.5 platform.**
