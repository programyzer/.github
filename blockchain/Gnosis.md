**Alternatives Considered: Gnosis Chain**

Gnosis Chain (formerly xDai Chain)  is an Ethereum sidechain designed with predictable transaction costs and fast speeds in mind. It offered these significant advantages for our Web 2.5 project:

* **Ethereum compatibility:**  Being EVM-compatible, Gnosis Chain shares a similar development environment to Ethereum. This would provide a smooth migration path if more complex smart contract capabilities become essential in the future.
* **Very low fees:** Gnosis Chain boasts remarkably low transaction costs, ensuring affordability for all users.
* **Speed:** The network offers fast transaction finality, which is important for a fluid user experience within our applications.

**Why Gnosis Chain Wasn't the Primary Choice**

* **Smart Contract Limitations (relative to Polygon):** While Gnosis Chain is evolving, its smart contract capabilities lack the full expressiveness supported by Polygon, which could be important for specific applications in our project's roadmap.

* **Smaller Developer Ecosystem (relative to both Polygon and Stellar):** While growing, Gnosis Chain has a less extensive developer community and a smaller set of readily available tools compared to our chosen blockchain. This could potentially lead to slower development cycles as we build new features.

**Potential for Gnosis Chain in Our Project**

Despite not being the primary choice, Gnosis Chain remains a strong contender for specific use cases:

* **Micropayments:** For applications with many very low-value transactions, Gnosis Chain could provide the most cost-effective solution.
* **Testing Ground:** Serving as a sidechain development environment to test ideas that might later migrate to a more expressive L1 chain or the main platform.

**We will actively monitor the Gnosis Chain ecosystem for advancements in both smart contract capabilities and developer support.**
