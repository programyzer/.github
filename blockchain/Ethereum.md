**Alternatives Considered: Ethereum**

Ethereum, the pioneering smart contract platform, offers several advantages that make it relevant to our Web 2.5 project:

* **Robust Decentralization and Security:** Ethereum boasts a highly decentralized network with a strong track record of security, aligning with our emphasis on censorship resistance.
* **Large Developer Community:** Ethereum's vast developer ecosystem offers extensive resources, tools, and support for building decentralized applications.
* **Smart Contract Expressiveness:** Ethereum supports highly expressive smart contracts, enabling us to implement complex features, governance mechanisms, or decentralized marketplaces.  

**Why Ethereum Wasn't the Primary Choice**

* **Scalability and Cost Limitations:** Ethereum's known issues with scalability and high transaction fees ('gas') present significant barriers to its adoption within our Web 2.5 project. Prioritizing accessibility and affordability for our libertarian communities led us to favor other platforms.
* **Complexity:** Ethereum's technical complexity can lead to a steeper learning curve for developers and increase development time, potentially slowing our project's progress.

**Potential for Ethereum in Our Project**

Despite the above limitations, Ethereum still holds value for certain aspects of our project:

* **Long-Term Foundation:** In the future, improvements in Ethereum's scalability, could make it more viable as the core blockchain for specific aspects of our platform.
* **Interoperability:** Ethereum could serve as a foundational layer for interacting with other Ethereum-based protocols or dApps, leveraging its vast ecosystem.

**We'll actively monitor Ethereum's evolution, especially regarding scalability solutions and Layer-2 developments, for potential integration points within our architecture.**
