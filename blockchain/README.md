# Blockchain Selection for Libertarian Web 2.5 Communities

**Date:** March 8, 2024

**Context**

A robust blockchain layer is crucial for our Web 2.5 platform as it will support features like:

* Decentralized identity systems
* Secure and auditable transactions (possibly through cryptocurrency)
* Tokenization of assets or reputation
* Basic smart contracts for governance or marketplace mechanisms where complex logic isn't the primary requirement

**Decision Drivers**

* **Decentralization and Censorship Resistance:**  Prioritize blockchains with a high degree of decentralization.
* **Scalability:** Handle a growing user base and a moderate volume of transactions.
* **Transaction Costs:** Prioritize extremely low fees to promote widespread accessibility.
* **Smart Contract Capabilities:**  The platform will initially focus on core transfer and exchange functionality, with potential for future expansion if needed.
* **Developer Ecosystem:**  Consider ease of development, tools, and community support.
* **Privacy Features:**  Exploration of solutions compatible with Stellar if privacy becomes a core requirement.

**Options Considered**

1. **Ethereum:** The most established smart contract platform with a strong community but known scalability issues and potentially high gas fees.
2. **Gnosis Chain:** An Ethereum sidechain focused on scalability with lower transaction costs and faster speeds.
3. **Stellar:** Primarily designed for efficient cross-border payments, offering fast and low-cost transactions, with more basic smart contract functionality.
4. **Polygon:** Ethereum scaling solution (Layer-2), offering higher throughput and lower fees while retaining Ethereum's security.
5. **Alternative Layer 1 Chains:** Examples include Cardano, Solana, Algorand (Evaluate based on decentralization, developer ecosystem, and alignment with project requirements)

**Decision**

**We will proceed with Stellar as the primary blockchain platform. Here's the reasoning:**

* **Unmatched Transaction Efficiency:** Stellar's core focus on payments and asset transfers aligns closely with our initial use cases, prioritizing speed and minimal transaction costs.
* **Solid Decentralization:** Stellar provides a robust, decentralized network.
* **Predictable Costs:** Stellar's fee model ensures predictable and affordable transactions.
* **Growing Smart Contract Functionality:** While Stellar's smart contracts are less expressive than some alternatives, they are sufficient for our early implementations. We can reassess if the need for more complex logic arises.
* **Future potential:** Stellar shows promise for scalability advancements and potential integrations with other systems for wider use cases.

**Risks and Mitigation:**

* **Smart Contract Limitations:** More complex applications might require other blockchains or bridging solutions in the future. We'll continue monitoring Stellar's development and other blockchain options.
* **Privacy:**  If strong privacy becomes a key requirement, we'll research privacy-focused solutions compatible with Stellar.

**Additional Considerations**

* We will actively explore the evolving Stellar ecosystem for tools and libraries simplifying development.
* Regular assessment of other blockchain solutions as possible enhancements for specific future use-cases.

**Conclusion:**

Stellar provides the ideal foundation for our Web 2.5 project due to its prioritization of cost-effective transactions, decentralization, and a supportive developer community. This decision aligns with our libertarian values, ensuring accessibility and affordability,  while allowing flexibility for future growth.
