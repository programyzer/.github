**Alternatives Considered: Polygon**

Polygon is a Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum that offers significant improvements in throughput and significantly reduced transaction costs. Here's why it was a solid contender for our project:

* **Smart Contract Expressiveness:** Polygon supports a wide range of smart contract capabilities, offering greater flexibility for implementing complex governance mechanisms, marketplaces, and other potential applications within our Web 2.5 platform.
* **Ethereum Ecosystem:** Polygon benefits from its close integration with Ethereum, providing access to a vast developer community, tools, and the wider Ethereum ecosystem.
* **Scalability:** Polygon can manage a large volume of transactions efficiently, ensuring that the platform could grow alongside our user base.

**Why Polygon Wasn't the Primary Choice**

* **Transaction Costs (relative to Stellar):** While Polygon offers substantially lower costs than Ethereum, its transaction fees are still slightly higher than those found on the Stellar Network. Our focus on minimizing costs for libertarian communities made Stellar a slightly better fit for the core platform.
* **Complexity:**  Polygon adds a layer of complexity when compared to Stellar's more streamlined design. This could potentially increase development overhead for some of our project's components.

**Potential for Polygon in Our Project**

Despite Stellar being the primary choice, Polygon still holds strong potential for specific applications within our Web 2.5 ecosystem:

* **Complex Smart Contracts:**  Use cases with highly expressive smart contracts could be ideal for running on Polygon, leveraging its capabilities.
* **Bridging to Ethereum:** If needed, Polygon could serve as a bridge to Ethereum for interaction with wider DeFi protocols or other Ethereum-based platforms.
* **Future Expansion:** If use cases arise that require higher throughput or features only present on Polygon, we could seamlessly integrate it alongside Stellar.

**We'll keep a close eye on Polygon's advancements, especially regarding transaction costs and cross-chain interoperability.**
