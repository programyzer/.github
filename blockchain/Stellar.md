**Detailed Justification for Stellar**

Stellar's advantages align exceptionally well with the fundamental principles guiding our libertarian Web 2.5 project:

* **Uncompromising Focus on Efficiency and Affordability:** Stellar's design prioritizes fast, low-cost transactions with a simple, predictable fee structure. This ensures maximum accessibility, as every user,  regardless of their means, can participate fully without worrying about fluctuating or exorbitant fees that plague other platforms. This fosters a more inclusive and equitable environment.

* **Emphasis on Core Functionality:**  Stellar excels at its core purposes of asset issuance, transfers, and decentralized exchange. This streamline focus means initial development on the platform can be more rapid. Smart contract functionality is present for essential governance or simple marketplaces, with the potential to add complexity as our project's needs expand.

* **Solid Decentralization and Growing Developer Ecosystem:** The Stellar network maintains a substantial number of independent validator nodes, ensuring a good level of decentralization and censorship resistance.   Its developer ecosystem, while smaller than some competitors, provides a strong foundation of tools and libraries for building our applications. 

* **Designed for Collaboration:** Stellar's emphasis on interoperability and integration with traditional financial systems positions it well for potential future cross-chain activities. This offers flexibility as our project grows and needs to interact with a wider range of services.

* **Values Alignment:** Stellar's emphasis on financial inclusion and empowering individuals resonates with the libertarian ethos. With a focus on transparency and cross-border payments,  this philosophy complements our goal of building open, accessible Web 2.5 communities. 

**Addressing Potential Concerns**

* **Smart Contract Limitations:** While Stellar's smart contracts are less expressive than those on Ethereum, they offer the necessary functionality for our initial use-cases.  We will actively monitor Stellar's smart contract advancements and continue to assess bridging solutions or alternative blockchains for use-cases demanding more complex logic.

* **Privacy:**  We will closely monitor the development of privacy-enhancing solutions within the Stellar ecosystem and work to integrate them into our platform if privacy becomes a central requirement.

**Conclusion:**

Stellar provides a remarkably strong foundation for our Web 2.5 platform. Its emphasis on cost-effective, fast, and reliable transactions directly addresses the needs of libertarian communities while offering a well-balanced set of features for decentralization and future growth.  This choice ensures sustainability, accessibility, and a strong alignment between our project's values and the underlying technology.
